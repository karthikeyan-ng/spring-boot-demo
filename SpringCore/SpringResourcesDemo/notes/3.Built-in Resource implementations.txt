						Resources
						---------
Built-in Resource implementations
---------------------------------

There are a number of Resource implementations that come supplied straight out of the box in Spring:

		- UrlResource
		- ClassPathResource
		- FileSystemResource
		- ServletContextResource
		- InputStreamResource
		- ByteArrayResource
		
UrlResource
-----------
The UrlResource wraps a java.net.URL, and may be used to access any object that is normally accessible via a URL, 
such as files, an HTTP target, an FTP target, etc.

All URLs have a standardized String representation, such that appropriate standardized prefixes are used to indicate 
one URL type from another.

This includes file: for accessing filesystem paths, http: for accessing resources via the HTTP protocol, ftp: 
for accessing resources via FTP, etc.

A UrlResource is created by Java code explicitly using the UrlResource constructor, but will often be created 
implicitly when you call an API method which takes a String argument which is meant to represent a path.

For the latter case, a JavaBeans PropertyEditor will ultimately decide which type of Resource to create. 
If the path string contains a few well-known (to it, that is) prefixes such as classpath:, it will create 
an appropriate specialized Resource for that prefix.

However, if it doesn’t recognize the prefix, it will assume that this is just a standard URL string, 
and will create a UrlResource.

ClassPathResource
-----------------
This class represents a resource which should be obtained from the classpath. 

This uses either the thread context class loader, a given class loader, or a given class for loading resources.

This Resource implementation supports resolution as java.io.File if the class path resource resides in the file system, 
but not for classpath resources which reside in a jar and have not been expanded (by the servlet engine, or whatever 
the environment is) to the filesystem.

To address this the various Resource implementations always support resolution as a java.net.URL.

A ClassPathResource is created by Java code explicitly using the ClassPathResource constructor, but will often be 
created implicitly when you call an API method which takes a String argument which is meant to represent a path.

For the latter case, a JavaBeans PropertyEditor will recognize the special prefix classpath: on the string path, 
and create a ClassPathResource in that case.

FileSystemResource
------------------
This is a Resource implementation for java.io.File handles. It obviously supports resolution as a File, and as a URL.

ServletContextResource
----------------------
This is a Resource implementation for ServletContext resources, interpreting relative paths within the relevant 
web application’s root directory.

This always supports stream access and URL access, but only allows java.io.File access when the web application 
archive is expanded and the resource is physically on the filesystem.

Whether or not it’s expanded and on the filesystem like this, or accessed directly from the JAR or somewhere else 
like a DB (it’s conceivable) is actually dependent on the Servlet container.

InputStreamResource
-------------------
A Resource implementation for a given InputStream. This should only be used if no specific Resource implementation 
is applicable. In particular, prefer ByteArrayResource or any of the file-based Resource implementations where possible.

In contrast to other Resource implementations, this is a descriptor for an already opened resource - therefore 
returning true from isOpen(). Do not use it if you need to keep the resource descriptor somewhere, or if you need 
to read a stream multiple times.

ByteArrayResource
-----------------
This is a Resource implementation for a given byte array. It creates a ByteArrayInputStream for the given byte array.

It’s useful for loading content from any given byte array, without having to resort to a single-use InputStreamResource.
