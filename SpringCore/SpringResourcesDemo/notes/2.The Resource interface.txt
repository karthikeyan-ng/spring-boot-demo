The Resource interface
----------------------
	
	To overcome the existing Java’s standard java.net.URL and it's low level resources access functionality...
	
	Spring’s Resource interface is meant to be a more capable interface for abstracting access to low-level resources.

Spring Resource interface
-------------------------

	public interface Resource extends InputStreamSource {

	    boolean exists();
	
	    boolean isOpen();
	
	    URL getURL() throws IOException;
	
	    File getFile() throws IOException;
	
	    Resource createRelative(String relativePath) throws IOException;
	
	    String getFilename();
	
	    String getDescription();
	
	}
	
	Some of the most important methods from the Resource interface are:
	
	* getInputStream(): locates and opens the resource, returning an InputStream for reading from the resource. 
	It is expected that each invocation returns a fresh InputStream. It is the responsibility of the caller to close 
	the stream.
	
	* exists(): returns a boolean indicating whether this resource actually exists in physical form.
	
	* isOpen(): returns a boolean indicating whether this resource represents a handle with an open stream. 
	If true, the InputStream cannot be read multiple times, and must be read once only and then closed to avoid 
	resource leaks. Will be false for all usual resource implementations, with the exception of InputStreamResource.
	
	* getDescription(): returns a description for this resource, to be used for error output when working with the 
	resource. This is often the fully qualified file name or the actual URL of the resource.
	
	Other methods allow you to obtain an actual URL or File object representing the resource (if the 
	underlying implementation is compatible, and supports that functionality).
	

The Resource abstraction is used extensively in Spring itself, as an argument type in many method signatures 
when a resource is needed.

Other methods in some Spring APIs (such as the constructors to various ApplicationContext implementations), take a 
String which in unadorned or simple form is used to create a Resource appropriate to that context implementation, 
or via special prefixes on the String path, allow the caller to specify that a specific Resource implementation 
must be created and used. 

While the Resource interface is used a lot with Spring and by Spring, it’s actually very useful to use as a general 
utility class by itself in your own code, for access to resources, even when your code doesn’t know or care about any 
other parts of Spring.

While this couples your code to Spring, it really only couples it to this small set of utility classes, which are serving 
as a more capable replacement for URL, and can be considered equivalent to any other library you would use for this purpose.

It is important to note that the Resource abstraction does not replace functionality: it wraps it where possible. 
For example, a UrlResource wraps a URL, and uses the wrapped URL to do its work.
