Application contexts and Resource paths
---------------------------------------

	Constructing application contexts
	---------------------------------
An application context constructor (for a specific application context type) generally takes a string or array of strings as the 
location path(s) of the resource(s) such as XML files that make up the definition of the context.

When such a location path doesn’t have a prefix, the specific Resource type built from that path and used to load the bean definitions, 
depends on and is appropriate to the specific application context. For example, if you create a ClassPathXmlApplicationContext as follows:

	ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");

The bean definitions will be loaded from the classpath, as a ClassPathResource will be used. But if you create a FileSystemXmlApplicationContext 
as follows:

	ApplicationContext ctx = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");
	
The bean definition will be loaded from a filesystem location, in this case relative to the current working directory.

Note that the use of the special classpath prefix or a standard URL prefix on the location path will override the default type of 
Resource created to load the definition. So this FileSystemXmlApplicationContext…​

	ApplicationContext ctx = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("classpath:conf/appContext.xml");

will actually load its bean definitions from the classpath. However, it is still a FileSystemXmlApplicationContext. If it is subsequently 
used as a ResourceLoader, any unprefixed paths will still be treated as filesystem paths.

			Constructing ClassPathXmlApplicationContext instances - shortcuts
			-----------------------------------------------------------------
			
The ClassPathXmlApplicationContext exposes a number of constructors to enable convenient instantiation. The basic idea is that 
one supplies merely a string array containing just the filenames of the XML files themselves (without the leading path information), and 
one also supplies a Class; the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext will derive the path information from the supplied class.

An example will hopefully make this clear. Consider a directory layout that looks like this:

	com/
  		foo/
		    services.xml
		    daos.xml
		    MessengerService.class
		    
A ClassPathXmlApplicationContext instance composed of the beans defined in the 'services.xml' and 'daos.xml' could be instantiated like so…​

	ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
    								new String[] {"services.xml", "daos.xml"}, MessengerService.class);
    								
Please do consult the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext javadocs for details on the various constructors.

	Wildcards in application context constructor resource paths
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	
The resource paths in application context constructor values may be a simple path (as shown above) which has a one-to-one mapping 
to a target Resource, or alternately may contain the special "classpath*:" prefix and/or internal Ant-style regular 
expressions (matched using Spring’s PathMatcher utility). Both of the latter are effectively wildcards

One use for this mechanism is when doing component-style application assembly. All components can 'publish' context definition 
fragments to a well-known location path, and when the final application context is created using the same path prefixed via classpath*:, 
all component fragments will be picked up automatically.

Note that this wildcarding is specific to use of resource paths in application context constructors (or when using the PathMatcher utility 
class hierarchy directly), and is resolved at construction time. It has nothing to do with the Resource type itself. It’s not possible to 
use the classpath*: prefix to construct an actual Resource, as a resource points to just one resource at a time.

		Ant-style Patterns
		------------------
When the path location contains an Ant-style pattern, for example:

	/WEB-INF/*-context.xml
	com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml
	file:C:/some/path/*-context.xml
	classpath:com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml
	
	- The resolver follows a more complex but defined procedure to try to resolve the wildcard.
	- It produces a Resource for the path up to the last non-wildcard segment and obtains a URL from it.
	- If this URL is not a jar: URL or container-specific variant (e.g. zip: in WebLogic, wsjar in WebSphere, etc.), then a java.io.File 
	is obtained from it and used to resolve the wildcard by traversing the filesystem.
	- In the case of a jar URL, the resolver either gets a java.net.JarURLConnection from it or manually parses the jar URL and then 
	traverses the contents of the jar file to resolve the wildcards.
	
			Implications on portability
			---------------------------
If the specified path is already a file URL (either explicitly, or implicitly because the base ResourceLoader is a filesystem one), 
then wildcarding is guaranteed to work in a completely portable fashion.

		The classpath*: prefix
		----------------------
When constructing an XML-based application context, a location string may use the special classpath*: prefix:

	ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("classpath*:conf/appContext.xml");
	
This special prefix specifies that all classpath resources that match the given name must be obtained (internally, this essentially 
happens via a ClassLoader.getResources(…​) call), and then merged to form the final application context definition.

The classpath*: prefix can also be combined with a PathMatcher pattern in the rest of the location path, for example classpath*:META-INF/*-beans.xml.

In this case, the resolution strategy is fairly simple: a ClassLoader.getResources() call is used on the last non-wildcard path segment 
to get all the matching resources in the class loader hierarchy, and then off each resource the same PathMatcher resolution strategy described 
above is used for the wildcard subpath.

Ant-style patterns with classpath: resources are not guaranteed to find matching resources if the root package to search is available in 
multiple class path locations. This is because a resource such as

	com/mycompany/package1/service-context.xml
	
may be in only one location, but when a path such as

	classpath:com/mycompany/**/service-context.xml
	
is used to try to resolve it, the resolver will work off the (first) URL returned by getResource("com/mycompany");. If this base package 
node exists in multiple classloader locations, the actual end resource may not be underneath. Therefore, preferably, use " `classpath*:`" 
with the same Ant-style pattern in such a case, which will search all class path locations that contain the root package.

======================================================================================================================

FileSystemResource caveats
--------------------------
A FileSystemResource that is not attached to a FileSystemApplicationContext (that is, a FileSystemApplicationContext is not the actual 
ResourceLoader) will treat absolute vs. relative paths as you would expect.

Relative paths are relative to the current working directory, while absolute paths are relative to the root of the filesystem.

For backwards compatibility (historical) reasons however, this changes when the FileSystemApplicationContext is the ResourceLoader. 
The FileSystemApplicationContext simply forces all attached FileSystemResource instances to treat all location paths as relative, 
whether they start with a leading slash or not.

	ApplicationContext ctx = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/context.xml");
	
	ApplicationContext ctx = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("/conf/context.xml");
	
As are the following: (Even though it would make sense for them to be different, as one case is relative and the other absolute.)

	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
	ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
	
	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
	ctx.getResource("/some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
	
In practice, if true absolute filesystem paths are needed, it is better to forgo the use of absolute paths with FileSystemResource / 
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext, and just force the use of a UrlResource, by using the file: URL prefix.

	// actual context type doesn't matter, the Resource will always be UrlResource
	ctx.getResource("file:///some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
	
	// force this FileSystemXmlApplicationContext to load its definition via a UrlResource
	ApplicationContext ctx =
    	new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("file:///conf/context.xml");
