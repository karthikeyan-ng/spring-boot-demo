						Resources
						---------
The ResourceLoaderAware interface
----------------------------------
The ResourceLoaderAware interface is a special marker interface, identifying objects that expect to be provided with a ResourceLoader reference.

	public interface ResourceLoaderAware {
	    void setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader resourceLoader);
	}
	
- When a class implements ResourceLoaderAware and is deployed into an application context (as a Spring-managed bean), it is recognized as 
ResourceLoaderAware by the application context.

- The application context will then invoke the setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader), supplying itself as the argument (remember, 
all application contexts in Spring implement the ResourceLoader interface).

- Of course, since an ApplicationContext is a ResourceLoader, the bean could also implement the ApplicationContextAware interface and use 
the supplied application context directly to load resources, but in general, it’s better to use the specialized ResourceLoader interface 
if that’s all that’s needed.

- The code would just be coupled to the resource loading interface, which can be considered a utility interface, and not the whole 
Spring ApplicationContext interface.

- As of Spring 2.5, you can rely upon autowiring of the ResourceLoader as an alternative to implementing the ResourceLoaderAware interface.
		
		- you can use in constructor argument
		
			@Autowired
			MyClass(ResourceLoader resource) {
			}
		
		- or setter method
			
			@Autowired
			setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader  resource) {
				....
			}
		
		- or field
			
			@Autowired
			ResourceLoader resourceLoader;
