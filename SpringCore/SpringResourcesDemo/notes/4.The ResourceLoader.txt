						Resources
						---------
The ResourceLoader
------------------
The ResourceLoader interface is meant to be implemented by objects that can return (i.e. load) Resource instances.

		public interface ResourceLoader {
		    Resource getResource(String location);
		}
		
All application contexts implement the ResourceLoader interface, and therefore all application contexts 
may be used to obtain Resource instances.

When you call getResource() on a specific application context, and the location path specified doesn’t have a 
specific prefix, you will get back a Resource type that is appropriate to that particular application context. 
For example, assume the following snippet of code was executed against a ClassPathXmlApplicationContext instance:

		Resource template = ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");

What would be returned would be a ClassPathResource; if the same method was executed against a 
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext instance, you’d get back a FileSystemResource. For a WebApplicationContext, 
you’d get back a ServletContextResource, and so on.

As such, you can load resources in a fashion appropriate to the particular application context.

On the other hand, you may also force ClassPathResource to be used, regardless of the application context type, 
by specifying the special classpath: prefix:

	Resource template = ctx.getResource("classpath:some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
