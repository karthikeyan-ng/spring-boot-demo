							Validation, Data Binding, and Type Conversion

		Validation using Spring’s Validator interface
		---------------------------------------------
		
- Spring features a Validator interface that you can use to validate objects. 

- The Validator interface works using an Errors object so that while validating, validators can report validation failures to the Errors object.

Let’s consider a small data object:

	Person.java - from com.techstack.spring.validator package
	
We’re going to provide validation behavior for the Person class by implementing the following two methods of the 
org.springframework.validation.Validator interface:

	- supports(Class) - Can this Validator validate instances of the supplied Class?
	
	- validate(Object, org.springframework.validation.Errors) - validates the given object and in case of validation errors, 
	registers those with the given Errors object
	
Implementing a Validator is fairly straightforward, especially when you know of the ValidationUtils helper class that the 
Spring Framework also provides.

	PersonValidator.java - from com.techstack.spring.validator package
