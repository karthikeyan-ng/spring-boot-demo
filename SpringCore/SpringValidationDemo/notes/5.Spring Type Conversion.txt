							Validation, Data Binding, and Type Conversion
							---------------------------------------------

		Spring Type Conversion
		----------------------
- Spring 3 introduces a core.convert package that provides a general type conversion system.

- The system defines an SPI to implement type conversion logic, as well as an API to execute type conversions at runtime.

- Within a Spring container, this system can be used as an alternative to PropertyEditors to convert externalized bean property 
value strings to required property types.

Converter SPI
-------------

- The SPI to implement type conversion logic is simple and strongly typed:

		package org.springframework.core.convert.converter;
		public interface Converter<S, T> {
		    T convert(S source);
		}

Developer can create your own converter, simply implement the interface above.

	- Parameters are
		- S : type you are converting from
		- T : the type you are converting to
		
Such a converter can also be applied transparently if a collection or array of S needs to be converted to an array or 
collection of T, provided that a delegating array/collection converter has been registered as well (which 
DefaultConversionService does by default).		

	Limitations: while accessing convert(S) method
		- developer should ensure S is NOT null. ELSE, converter may throw any unchecked exception if conversion fails;
		specifically, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown to report an invalid source value.
		
		- Take care to ensure that your Converter implementation is thread-safe.
		
	- Spring offers various converter implementations in the core.convert.support package as a convenience.
	- These include converters from Strings to Numbers and other common types.
			Few example converters are...
				- org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToInteger.java
				- and many more...
				
======================================================================================
ConverterFactory
----------------
When you need to centralize the conversion logic for an entire class hierarchy, for example, when converting from String 
to java.lang.Enum objects, implement ConverterFactory:

	package org.springframework.core.convert.converter;
	public interface ConverterFactory<S, R> {
	    <T extends R> Converter<S, T> getConverter(Class<T> targetType);
	}
	
	Here:
		S - to be the type you are converting from
		R - to be the base type defining the range of classes you can convert to.
		Then implement getConverter(Class<T>), where T is a subclass of R.
	
	Refer: StringToEnumConverterFactory.java
	
======================================================================================
GenericConverter
----------------
- When you require a sophisticated Converter implementation, consider the GenericConverter interface.
- It is more flexible but less strongly typed signature, a GenericConverter supports converting between multiple 
source and target types.
- A GenericConverter makes available source and target field context you can use when implementing your conversion logic.
- Such context allows a type conversion to be driven by a field annotation, or generic information declared on a field signature.

		package org.springframework.core.convert.converter;
		public interface GenericConverter {
		    public Set<ConvertiblePair> getConvertibleTypes();
		    Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
		}

	How to use GenericConverter:
		- have getConvertibleTypes() return the supported source→target type pairs
		- Then implement convert(Object, TypeDescriptor, TypeDescriptor) to implement your conversion logic.
		
		- The source TypeDescriptor provides access to the source field holding the value being converted.
		- The target TypeDescriptor provides access to the target field where the converted value will be set.
	
	Example: a converter that converts between a Java Array and a Collection.
		Such an ArrayToCollectionConverter introspects the field that declares the target Collection type to resolve the 
		Collection’s element type.
		
		This allows each element in the source array to be converted to the Collection element type before the Collection 
		is set on the target field.
		
NOTE: Because GenericConverter is a more complex SPI interface, only use it when you need it. Favor Converter or 
ConverterFactory for basic type conversion needs.

ConditionalGenericConverter
---------------------------
- Sometimes you only want a Converter to execute if a specific condition holds true
- For example, 
	- you might only want to execute a Converter if a specific annotation is present on the target field. OR
	- you might only want to execute a Converter if a specific method, such as a static valueOf method, is defined on the 
	target class.

- ConditionalGenericConverter is the union of the GenericConverter and ConditionalConverter interfaces that allows you 
to define such custom matching criteria:

Example:
	A good example of a ConditionalGenericConverter is an EntityConverter that converts between an persistent entity 
	identifier and an entity reference. Such a EntityConverter might only match if the target entity type declares a 
	static finder method e.g. findAccount(Long). You would perform such a finder method check in the implementation of 
	matches(TypeDescriptor, TypeDescriptor).
	
======================================================================================

ConversionService API
---------------------
The ConversionService defines a unified API for executing type conversion logic at runtime. Converters are often executed 
behind this facade interface:

	package org.springframework.core.convert;

	public interface ConversionService {
	
	    boolean canConvert(Class<?> sourceType, Class<?> targetType);
	
	    <T> T convert(Object source, Class<T> targetType);
	
	    boolean canConvert(TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
	
	    Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);
	
	}
	
Most ConversionService implementations also implement ConverterRegistry, which provides an SPI for registering converters. 
Internally, a ConversionService implementation delegates to its registered converters to carry out type conversion logic.

A robust ConversionService implementation is provided in the core.convert.support package. GenericConversionService is the 
general-purpose implementation suitable for use in most environments. ConversionServiceFactory provides a convenient factory 
for creating common ConversionService configurations.

======================================================================================

Configuring a ConversionService
-------------------------------
-A ConversionService is a stateless object designed to be instantiated at application startup, then shared between 
multiple threads.

-In a Spring application, you typically configure a ConversionService instance per Spring container (or ApplicationContext).

- That ConversionService will be picked up by Spring and then used whenever a type conversion needs to be performed by 
the framework.

- You may also inject this ConversionService into any of your beans and invoke it directly.

TIP: If no ConversionService is registered with Spring, the original PropertyEditor-based system is used.

To register a default ConversionService with Spring, add the following bean definition with id conversionService:

	<bean id="conversionService" class="org.springframework.context.support.ConversionServiceFactoryBean"/>
	
A default ConversionService can convert between strings, numbers, enums, collections, maps, and other common types. To 
supplement or override the default converters with your own custom converter(s), set the converters property.
Property values may implement either of the Converter, ConverterFactory, or GenericConverter interfaces.

	<bean id="conversionService"
        class="org.springframework.context.support.ConversionServiceFactoryBean">
	    <property name="converters">
	        <set>
	            <bean class="example.MyCustomConverter"/>
	        </set>
	    </property>
	</bean>
	
======================================================================================
Using a ConversionService programmatically
-------------------------------------------
	 
To work with a ConversionService instance programmatically, simply inject a reference to it like you would for any other bean:

	@Service
	public class MyService {
	
	    @Autowired
	    public MyService(ConversionService conversionService) {
	        this.conversionService = conversionService;
	    }
	
	    public void doIt() {
	        this.conversionService.convert(...)
	    }
	}
	
For most use cases, the convert method specifying the targetType can be used but it will not work with more complex types 
such as a collection of a parameterized element.	 

If you want to convert a List of Integer to a List of String programmatically, for instance, you need to provide a 
formal definition of the source and target types.

Fortunately, TypeDescriptor provides various options to make that straightforward:

	DefaultConversionService cs = new DefaultConversionService();

	List<Integer> input = ....
	cs.convert(input,
	    TypeDescriptor.forObject(input), // List<Integer> type descriptor
	    TypeDescriptor.collection(List.class, TypeDescriptor.valueOf(String.class)));
	    
Note that DefaultConversionService registers converters automatically which are appropriate for most environments.

This includes collection converters, scalar converters, and also basic Object to String converters.

The same converters can be registered with any ConverterRegistry using the static addDefaultConverters method on the 
DefaultConversionService class.
