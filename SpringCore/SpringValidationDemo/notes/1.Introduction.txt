							Validation, Data Binding, and Type Conversion

JSR-303/JSR-349 Bean Validation
-------------------------------
Spring Framework 4.0 supports Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303) and Bean Validation 1.1 (JSR-349) 
in terms of setup support, also adapting it to Spring’s Validator interface.

An application can choose to enable Bean Validation once globally, as described in Spring Validation, 
and use it exclusively for all validation needs.

An application can also register additional Spring Validator instances per DataBinder instance, 
as described in Configuring a DataBinder. This may be useful for plugging in validation 
logic without the use of annotations.


Validation Pros / cons
----------------------
- There are pros and cons for considering validation as business logic, and Spring offers a design for validation (and data binding) 
that does not exclude either one of them.

- Specifically validation should not be tied to the web tier, should be easy to localize and it should be possible to plug in any validator available.

- Considering the above, Spring has come up with a Validator interface that is both basic and eminently usable in every layer of an application.

- Data binding is useful for allowing user input to be dynamically bound to the domain model of an application (or whatever objects you 
use to process user input).

- Spring provides the so-called DataBinder to do exactly that.

- The Validator and the DataBinder make up the validation package, which is primarily used in but not limited to the MVC framework.

- The BeanWrapper is a fundamental concept in the Spring Framework and is used in a lot of places.
		- However, you probably will not have the need to use the BeanWrapper directly.
		- Because this is reference documentation however, we felt that some explanation might be in order.

- Spring’s DataBinder and the lower-level BeanWrapper both use PropertyEditors to parse and format property values.

- The PropertyEditor concept is part of the JavaBeans specification, and is also explained in this chapter.

- Spring 3 introduces a "core.convert" package that provides a general type conversion facility, as well as a higher-level "format" package for formatting UI field values.

- These new packages may be used as simpler alternatives to PropertyEditors, and will also be discussed in this chapter.
