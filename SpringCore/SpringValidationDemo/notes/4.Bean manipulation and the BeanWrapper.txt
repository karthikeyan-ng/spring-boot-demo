							Validation, Data Binding, and Type Conversion
							---------------------------------------------

		Bean manipulation and the BeanWrapper
		-------------------------------------
- The org.springframework.beans package adheres to the JavaBeans standard provided by Oracle.

- One quite important class in the beans package is the BeanWrapper interface and its corresponding implementation (BeanWrapperImpl).

- Functionality of BeanWrapper interface is
	- to set and get property values (individually or in bulk)
	- get property descriptors
	- to query properties to determine if they are readable or writable
	- the BeanWrapper offers support for nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. 
	- it supports the ability to add standard JavaBeans PropertyChangeListeners and VetoableChangeListeners without the need for supporting 
	code in the target class
	- it provides support for the setting of indexed properties.
	
Usage: How to use BeanWrapper?
	- The BeanWrapper usually isn’t used by application code directly, but by the DataBinder and the BeanFactory.
	- The way the BeanWrapper works is partly indicated by its name: it wraps a bean to perform actions on that bean, like setting and retrieving properties.
	

Setting and getting basic and nested properties
-----------------------------------------------
	- Setting and getting properties is done using the setPropertyValue(s) and getPropertyValue(s) methods that both come with a couple of overloaded variants.
	
	- important to know is that there are a couple of conventions for indicating properties of an object.
	
	Examples of properties
	----------------------
	(*) name - Indicates the property name corresponding to the methods getName() or isName() and setName(..)
	
	(*) account.name - Indicates the nested property name of the property account corresponding 
			e.g. to the methods getAccount().setName() or getAccount().getName()
			
	(*) account[2] - Indicates the third element of the indexed property account. Indexed properties can be of 
			type array, list or other naturally ordered collection
			
	(*) account[COMPANYNAME] - Indicates the value of the map entry indexed by the key COMPANYNAME of the Map property account

Built-in PropertyEditor implementations
---------------------------------------
	- Spring uses the concept of PropertyEditors to effect the conversion between an Object and a String.
	
	- If you think about it, it sometimes might be handy to be able to represent properties in a different way than the 
	object itself.
	
	- Example:
		a Date can be represented in a human readable way (as the String '2007-14-09'), while we’re still able to 
		convert the human readable form back to the original date (or even better: convert any date entered in a human 
		readable form, back to Date objects).
		
		This behavior can be achieved by registering custom editors, of type java.beans.PropertyEditor.
		
	- Spring has a number of built-in PropertyEditors to make life easy. 
		- Each of those is listed below and they are all located in the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package.
		
		(*) ByteArrayPropertyEditor - Editor for byte arrays. Strings will simply be converted to their corresponding byte 
		representations. Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) ClassEditor - Parses Strings representing classes to actual classes and the other way around. When a class 
		is not found, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) CustomCollectionEditor - Property editor for Collections, converting any source Collection to a given target Collection type.
		
		(*) CustomDateEditor - Customizable property editor for java.util.Date, supporting a custom DateFormat. NOT 
		registered by default. Must be user registered as needed with appropriate format.
		
		(*) CustomNumberEditor - Customizable property editor for any Number subclass like Integer, Long, Float, Double. 
		Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl, but can be overridden by registering custom instance of it as a 
		custom editor.
		
		(*) FileEditor - Capable of resolving Strings to java.io.File objects. Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) InputStreamEditor - One-way property editor, capable of taking a text string and producing (via an intermediate 
		ResourceEditor and Resource) an InputStream, so InputStream properties may be directly set as Strings. Note that 
		the default usage will not close the InputStream for you! Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) LocaleEditor - Capable of resolving Strings to Locale objects and vice versa (the String format is 
		[country][variant], which is the same thing the toString() method of Locale provides). Registered by default 
		by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) PatternEditor - Capable of resolving Strings to java.util.regex.Pattern objects and vice versa.
		
		(*) PropertiesEditor - Capable of converting Strings (formatted using the format as defined in the javadocs of 
		the java.util.Properties class) to Properties objects. Registered by default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
		(*) StringTrimmerEditor - Property editor that trims Strings. Optionally allows transforming an empty string into a 
		null value. NOT registered by default; must be user registered as needed.
		
		(*) URLEditor - Capable of resolving a String representation of a URL to an actual URL object. Registered by 
		default by BeanWrapperImpl.
		
	- Spring uses the java.beans.PropertyEditorManager to set the search path for property editors that might be needed.
	
	- The standard JavaBeans infrastructure will automatically discover PropertyEditor classes (without you having to 
	register them explicitly) if they are in the same package as the class they handle, and have the same name as that 
	class, with 'Editor' appended
	
		- Example:
				one could have the following class and package structure, which would be sufficient for the 
				FooEditor class to be recognized and used as the PropertyEditor for Foo-typed properties.
				
				com
				 |_chank
				     |_pop
				      	|_Foo.java
				      	|_FooEditor.java // the PropertyEditor for the Foo class
				      	
				Alternatively, you can also use the standard BeanInfo JavaBeans mechanism here as well (described in 
				not-amazing-detail here). Find below an example of using the BeanInfo mechanism for explicitly registering 
				one or more PropertyEditor instances with the properties of an associated class.
				
				com
				 |_chank
				     |_pop
				      	|_Foo.java
				      	|_FooBean.java // the BeanInfo for the Foo class

PropertyEditorRegistrar in Spring MVC
--------------------------------------
for those of you using Spring’s MVC web framework, using PropertyEditorRegistrars in conjunction with data-binding 
Controllers (such as SimpleFormController) can be very convenient. Find below an example of using a PropertyEditorRegistrar 
in the implementation of an initBinder(..) method:
