				Spring Validation
				---------------------------------------
Spring supports 
	- JSR-303 Bean Validation API is now fully supported.
	- When used programmatically, Spring’s DataBinder can now validate objects as well as bind to them
	- Spring MVC now has support for declaratively validating @Controller inputs.
	
Overview of the JSR-303 Bean Validation API
-------------------------------------------
- JSR-303 standardizes validation constraint declaration and metadata for the Java platform.
- Using this API, you annotate domain model properties with declarative validation constraints and the runtime enforces them.
- There are a number of built-in constraints you can take advantage of.
- You may also define your own custom constraints.

For general information on JSR-303/JSR-349, see the Bean Validation website. For information on the specific 
capabilities of the default reference implementation, see the Hibernate Validator documentation. To learn how to 
setup a Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean, keep reading.

Configuring a Bean Validation Provider
--------------------------------------
Spring provides full support for the Bean Validation API. This includes convenient support for bootstrapping a JSR-303/JSR-349 
Bean Validation provider as a Spring bean.

This allows for a javax.validation.ValidatorFactory or javax.validation.Validator to be injected wherever validation is needed 
in your application.

Use the LocalValidatorFactoryBean to configure a default Validator as a Spring bean:

	<bean id="validator"
	    class="org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation.LocalValidatorFactoryBean"/>
	    
The basic configuration above will trigger Bean Validation to initialize using its default bootstrap mechanism.

A JSR-303/JSR-349 provider, such as Hibernate Validator, is expected to be present in the classpath and will be detected 
automatically.

	Injecting a Validator
	---------------------
	LocalValidatorFactoryBean implements both javax.validation.ValidatorFactory and javax.validation.Validator, as well as 
	Spring’s org.springframework.validation.Validator. You may inject a reference to either of these interfaces into 
	beans that need to invoke validation logic.
	
	Injecting Validator reference from 
		- javax.validation.Validator if you prefer to work with the Bean Validation API directly
		- org.springframework.validation.Validator if your bean requires the Spring Validation API:
		
	Configuring Custom Constraints
	------------------------------
	Each Bean Validation constraint consists of two parts. 
		- First, a @Constraint annotation that declares the constraint and its configurable properties.
		- Second, an implementation of the javax.validation.ConstraintValidator interface that implements the constraint’s behavior.
		
		At runtime, a ConstraintValidatorFactory instantiates the referenced implementation when the constraint annotation is 
		encountered in your domain model.
