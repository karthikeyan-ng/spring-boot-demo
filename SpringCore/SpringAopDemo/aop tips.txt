Tips:
=====
Autodetecting aspects through component scanning
		You may register aspect classes as regular beans in your Spring XML configuration, or 
		autodetect them through classpath scanning - just like any other Spring-managed bean. 
		However, note that the @Aspect annotation is not sufficient for autodetection in the classpath: 
		For that purpose, you need to add a separate @Component annotation 
		(or alternatively a custom stereotype annotation that qualifies, as per the rules of Spring’s component scanner).
		
Advising aspects with other aspects?
		In Spring AOP, it is not possible to have aspects themselves be the target of advice from other aspects. 
		The @Aspect annotation on a class marks it as an aspect, and hence excludes it from auto-proxying.
