	Aspect instantiation models (advance topic)
	
	By default there will be a single instance of each aspect within the application context. 
	AspectJ calls this the singleton instantiation model. 
	It is possible to define aspects with alternate lifecycles :- 
	Spring supports AspectJ’s perthis and pertarget instantiation models 
	( percflow, percflowbelow, and pertypewithin are not currently supported).

	A "perthis" aspect is declared by specifying a perthis clause in the @Aspect annotation. 
	Let’s look at an example, and then we’ll explain how it works.
	
	@Aspect("perthis(com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService())")
	public class MyAspect {

	    private int someState;
	
	    @Before(com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.businessService())
	    public void recordServiceUsage() {
	        // ...
	    }
	
	}
	
	The effect of the 'perthis' clause is that one aspect instance will be created 
	for each unique service object executing a business service (each unique 
	object bound to 'this' at join points matched by the pointcut expression). 
	The aspect instance is created the first time that a method is invoked on the service object. 
	The aspect goes out of scope when the service object goes out of scope. 
	Before the aspect instance is created, none of the advice within it executes. 
	As soon as the aspect instance has been created, the advice declared within 
	it will execute at matched join points, but only when the service object 
	is the one this aspect is associated with. See the AspectJ programming guide for more information on per-clauses.

	The 'pertarget' instantiation model works in exactly the same way as perthis, 
	but creates one aspect instance for each unique target object at matched join points.
