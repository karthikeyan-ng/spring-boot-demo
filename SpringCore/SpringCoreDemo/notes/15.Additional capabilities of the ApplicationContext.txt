Additional capabilities of the ApplicationContext
-------------------------------------------------
As was discussed in the chapter introduction, the org.springframework.beans.factory package provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating beans, 
including in a programmatic way.

The org.springframework.context package adds the ApplicationContext interface, which extends the BeanFactory interface, in addition to extending other 
interfaces to provide additional functionality in a more application framework-oriented style.

Many people use the ApplicationContext in a completely declarative fashion, not even creating it programmatically, but instead relying on support classes 
such as ContextLoader to automatically instantiate an ApplicationContext as part of the normal startup process of a Java EE web application.

	To enhance BeanFactory functionality in a more framework-oriented style the context package also provides the following functionality:
		
		- Access to messages in i18n-style, through the MessageSource interface.
		
		- Access to resources, such as URLs and files, through the ResourceLoader interface.
		
		- Event publication to namely beans implementing the ApplicationListener interface, through the use of the ApplicationEventPublisher interface.
		
		- Loading of multiple (hierarchical) contexts, allowing each to be focused on one particular layer, such as the web layer of an application, 
		through the HierarchicalBeanFactory interface.
		
Internationalization using MessageSource
----------------------------------------
The ApplicationContext interface extends an interface called MessageSource, and therefore provides internationalization (i18n) functionality. 
Spring also provides the interface HierarchicalMessageSource, which can resolve messages hierarchically. 
Together these interfaces provide the foundation upon which Spring effects message resolution. 
The methods defined on these interfaces include:

	- String getMessage(String code, Object[] args, String default, Locale loc):
			The basic method used to retrieve a message from the MessageSource. When no message is found for the specified locale, 
			the default message is used. Any arguments passed in become replacement values, using the MessageFormat functionality provided by 
			the standard library.
			
	- String getMessage(String code, Object[] args, Locale loc):
			Essentially the same as the previous method, but with one difference: no default message can be specified; 
			if the message cannot be found, a NoSuchMessageException is thrown.
			
	- String getMessage(MessageSourceResolvable resolvable, Locale locale):
			All properties used in the preceding methods are also wrapped in a class named MessageSourceResolvable, which you can use with this method.
			
When an ApplicationContext is loaded, it automatically searches for a MessageSource bean defined in the context. 
The bean must have the name messageSource. If such a bean is found, all calls to the preceding methods are delegated to the message source. 
If no message source is found, the ApplicationContext attempts to find a parent containing a bean with the same name. 
If it does, it uses that bean as the MessageSource. If the ApplicationContext cannot find any source for messages, an empty 
DelegatingMessageSource is instantiated in order to be able to accept calls to the methods defined above.

Spring provides two MessageSource implementations, 
	ResourceBundleMessageSource and 
	StaticMessageSource. 
Both implement HierarchicalMessageSource in order to do nested messaging. 
The StaticMessageSource is rarely used but provides programmatic ways to add messages to the source. 
The ResourceBundleMessageSource is shown in the following example:

- With regard to internationalization (i18n), Spring’s various MessageSource implementations follow the same locale resolution and fallback rules as the standard JDK ResourceBundle.
- In short, and continuing with the example messageSource defined previously, if you want to resolve messages against the British (en-GB) locale, 
		you would create files called as given below. 
			format_en_GB.properties, 
			exceptions_en_GB.properties, and 
			windows_en_GB.properties.
			
============================================================================
Standard and custom events
--------------------------
Event handling in the ApplicationContext is provided through the ApplicationEvent class and ApplicationListener interface. 
If a bean that implements the ApplicationListener interface is deployed into the context, every time an 
ApplicationEvent gets published to the ApplicationContext, that bean is notified. Essentially, this is the standard Observer design pattern.

Spring provides the following standard events: (Built-in events)
	- ContextRefreshedEvent 
	- ContextStartedEvent
	- ContextStoppedEvent
	- ContextClosedEvent
	- RequestHandledEvent (MVC)

Convenient access to low-level resources
----------------------------------------
For optimal usage and understanding of application contexts, users should generally familiarize themselves with 
Spring’s Resource abstraction, as described in the chapter Resources (2nd chapter).

============================================================================
Convenient ApplicationContext instantiation for web applications
----------------------------------------------------------------
You can create ApplicationContext instances declaratively by using, for example, a ContextLoader. Of course you can also 
create ApplicationContext instances programmatically by using one of the ApplicationContext implementations.

You can register an ApplicationContext using the ContextLoaderListener as follows:

	<context-param>
	    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
	    <param-value>/WEB-INF/daoContext.xml /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>
	
	<listener>
	    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
	</listener>
	
The listener inspects the contextConfigLocation parameter. 
 - If the parameter does not exist, the listener uses /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml as a default. 
 - When the parameter does exist, the listener separates the String by using predefined delimiters (comma, semicolon and whitespace) 
and uses the values as locations where application contexts will be searched.
 - Ant-style path patterns are supported as well. 
 	- Examples are /WEB-INF/*Context.xml for all files with names ending with "Context.xml", residing in the "WEB-INF" directory
 	- and /WEB-INF/**/*Context.xml, for all such files in any subdirectory of "WEB-INF".
