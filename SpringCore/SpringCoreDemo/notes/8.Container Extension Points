Container Extension Points
--------------------------
	Spring suggest developers does not need to subclass ApplicationContext implementation classes. Instead, 
	the Spring IoC container can be extended by plugging in implementations of special integration interfaces.

	Customizing beans using a BeanPostProcessor
	-------------------------------------------
	The BeanPostProcessor interface defines callback methods that you can implement to provide your 
	own (or override the container’s default) instantiation logic, dependency-resolution logic, and so forth.
	
	If you want to implement some custom logic after the Spring container finishes instantiating, configuring, 
	and initializing a bean, you can plug in one or more BeanPostProcessor implementations.
	
	You can configure multiple BeanPostProcessor instances, and you can control the order in which these 
	BeanPostProcessors execute by setting the order property.
	
	You can set this order property only if the BeanPostProcessor implements the Ordered interface;
	
	if you write your own BeanPostProcessor you should consider implementing the Ordered interface too.
	
	BeanFactoryPostProcessor
	-----------------------
	BeanFactoryPostProcessor works on the bean definitions or configuration meta data of the bean before beans are actually created. 
	
	Spring provides multiple BeanFactoryPostProcessor beans, so it invoked to resolve run time dependencies such reading value from external property files.
	
	BeanFactoryPostProcessor can modify the definition of any bean.
	
	If you define a BeanFactoryPostProcessor in one container, it will only be applied to the bean definitions in that container.
	
		Customizing BeanFactoryPostProcessor
		------------------------------------
		Ref: https://www.dineshonjava.com/writing-beanfactorypostprocessor-in/
		
		A bean factory post-processor is a java class which implements the org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanFactoryPostProcessor interface.
		
		It is executed manually (in the case of the BeanFactory) or automatically (in the case of the ApplicationContext) to apply changes of some sort 
		to an entire BeanFactory, after it has been constructed.
		
		Spring includes a number of pre-existing bean factory post-processors, such as given below
		
		PropertyResourceConfigurer and PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer – implemented as a bean factory post-processor, is used to externalize some property values 
		from a BeanFactory definition, into another separate file in Java Properties format.
		
		
		Customizing instantiation logic with a FactoryBean
		--------------------------------------------------
		Implement the org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean interface for objects that are themselves factories.
		
		The FactoryBean interface is a point of pluggability into the Spring IoC container’s instantiation logic. If you have complex initialization code that is 
		better expressed in Java as opposed to a (potentially) verbose amount of XML, you can create your own FactoryBean, write the complex initialization inside 
		that class, and then plug your custom FactoryBean into the container.
		
		The FactoryBean concept and interface is used in a number of places within the Spring Framework; more than 50 implementations of the FactoryBean interface 
		ship with Spring itself.

		When you need to ask a container for an actual FactoryBean instance itself instead of the bean it produces, preface the bean’s id with the 
		ampersand symbol ( &) when calling the getBean() method of the ApplicationContext. So for a given FactoryBean with an id of myBean, 
		invoking getBean("myBean") on the container returns the product of the FactoryBean; whereas, invoking getBean("&myBean") returns the FactoryBean instance itself.
