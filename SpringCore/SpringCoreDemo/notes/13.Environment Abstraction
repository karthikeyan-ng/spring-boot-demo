Environment Abstraction
-----------------------
The Environment is an abstraction integrated in the container that models two key aspects of the application environment: profiles and properties.

Profile
-------
A profile is a named, logical group of bean definitions to be registered with the container only if the given profile is active.
Beans may be assigned to a profile whether defined in XML or via annotations.
The role of the Environment object with relation to profiles is in determining which profiles (if any) are currently active, and which profiles (if any) should be active by default.

Properties
----------
Properties play an important role in almost all applications, and may originate from a variety of sources:
	properties files, 
	JVM system properties, 
	system environment variables, 
	JNDI, 
	servlet context parameters, 
	ad-hoc Properties objects, 
	Maps, and so on.
The role of the Environment object with relation to properties is to provide the user with a convenient service interface for configuring property sources and resolving properties from them.

Bean Definition Profiles
------------------------
Bean definition profiles is a mechanism in the core container that allows for registration of different beans in different environments.
The word environment can mean different things to different users and this feature can help with many use cases, including:
	- working against an in-memory datasource in development vs looking up that same datasource from JNDI when in QA or production
	- registering monitoring infrastructure only when deploying an application into a performance environment
	- registering customized implementations of beans for customer A vs. customer B deployments
	
Problem Scenario
----------------
	We have a local DataSource implementation using HSQL database and on the higher environment like QA/PROD DataSource will be pick up from JNDI context.
	The problem is how to switch between using these two variations based on the current environment. 
	
	Over time, Spring users have devised a number of ways to get this done, usually relying on a combination of system environment variables and 
	XML <import/> statements containing ${placeholder} tokens that resolve to the correct configuration file path depending on the value of an environment variable.
  	
  	Bean definition profiles is a core container feature that provides a solution to this problem.
  	
  	If we generalize the example use case above of environment-specific bean definitions, we end up with the need to register certain bean definitions 
  	in certain contexts, while not in others. You could say that you want to register a certain profile of bean definitions in situation A, and a different profile in situation B.
  	
Local:
	@Bean
	public DataSource dataSource() {
	    return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
	        .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.HSQL)
	        .addScript("my-schema.sql")
	        .addScript("my-test-data.sql")
	        .build();
	}  	
	
QA/PROD:
	@Bean(destroyMethod="")
	public DataSource dataSource() throws Exception {
	    Context ctx = new InitialContext();
	    return (DataSource) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource");
	}
	
using @Profile annotation.

@Profile can be used as a meta-annotation for the purpose of creating a custom composed annotation. 
The following example defines a custom @Production annotation that can be used as a drop-in replacement for @Profile("production")

TIP
---
If a @Configuration class is marked with @Profile, all of the @Bean methods and @Import annotations associated with that class will be 
bypassed unless one or more of the specified profiles are active. If a @Component or @Configuration class is marked with @Profile({"p1", "p2"}), 
that class will not be registered/processed unless profiles 'p1' and/or 'p2' have been activated. If a given profile is prefixed with the NOT operator (!), 
the annotated element will be registered if the profile is not active. For example, given @Profile({"p1", "!p2"}), registration will occur if profile 
'p1' is active or if profile 'p2' is not active.


@Profile - applies to @Bean creation method level.

XML bean definition profiles
----------------------------
<beans profile="development" ....>
</beans>

<beans ...>
	
	<beans profile="development">
        <jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource">
            <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/schema.sql"/>
            <jdbc:script location="classpath:com/bank/config/sql/test-data.sql"/>
        </jdbc:embedded-database>
    </beans>

    <beans profile="production">
        <jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="java:comp/env/jdbc/datasource"/>
    </beans>
</beans>

Activating a profile
--------------------
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("development");
ctx.register(SomeConfig.class, StandaloneDataConfig.class, JndiDataConfig.class);
ctx.refresh();

In addition, profiles may also be activated declaratively through 
	- the spring.profiles.active property which may be specified through system environment variables, 
	- JVM system properties, 
	- servlet context parameters in web.xml, or 
	- even as an entry in JNDI (see PropertySource abstraction). 

Default profile
---------------
The default profile represents the profile that is enabled by default. Consider the following:

Refer "DefaultDataConfig.java"

If no profile is active, the dataSource above will be created; this can be seen as a way to provide a default definition for one or more beans. 
If any profile is enabled, the default profile will not apply.

The name of the default profile can be changed using setDefaultProfiles() on the Environment or declaratively using the spring.profiles.default property.

==================================================================================================

PropertySource abstraction
--------------------------
Spring’s Environment abstraction provides search operations over a configurable hierarchy of property sources.

	ApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();
	Environment env = ctx.getEnvironment();
	boolean containsFoo = env.containsProperty("foo");
	System.out.println("Does my environment contain the 'foo' property? " + containsFoo);
	
In the snippet above, we see a high-level way of asking Spring whether the foo property is defined for the current environment. 
To answer this question, the Environment object performs a search over a set of PropertySource objects. A PropertySource is a simple abstraction over 
any source of key-value pairs, and Spring’s StandardEnvironment is configured with two PropertySource objects — one representing the 
set of JVM system properties (a la System.getProperties()) and one representing the set of system environment variables (a la System.getenv()).

For a common StandardServletEnvironment, the full hierarchy looks as follows, with the highest-precedence entries at the top:
	ServletConfig parameters (if applicable, e.g. in case of a DispatcherServlet context)
	ServletContext parameters (web.xml context-param entries)
	JNDI environment variables ("java:comp/env/" entries)
	JVM system properties ("-D" command-line arguments)
	JVM system environment (operating system environment variables)
	

	Custom configurable property
	----------------------------
	Most importantly, the entire mechanism is configurable. Perhaps you have a custom source of properties that you’d like to integrate into this search. 
	No problem — simply implement and instantiate your own PropertySource and add it to the set of PropertySources for the current Environment:
	
	ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext();
	MutablePropertySources sources = ctx.getEnvironment().getPropertySources();
	sources.addFirst(new MyPropertySource());
	
	In the code above, MyPropertySource has been added with highest precedence in the search. If it contains a foo property, it will be detected and 
	returned ahead of any foo property in any other PropertySource.
	
	@PropertySource
	---------------
	The @PropertySource annotation provides a convenient and declarative mechanism for adding a PropertySource to Spring’s Environment.
	
	Given a file "app.properties" containing the key/value pair testbean.name=myTestBean, the following @Configuration class uses 
	@PropertySource in such a way that a call to testBean.getName() will return "myTestBean".
