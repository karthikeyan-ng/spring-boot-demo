Customizing the nature of a bean
--------------------------------

	Initialization callbacks
	------------------------
	- To interact with the container’s management of the bean lifecycle, you can implement the Spring InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces.
	
	- The container calls afterPropertiesSet() for the former and destroy() for the latter to allow the bean to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction of your beans.
	
	- The JSR-250 @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations are generally considered best practice for receiving lifecycle callbacks in a modern 
	Spring application. Using these annotations means that your beans are not coupled to Spring specific interfaces. 
	
	- The Spring Framework uses BeanPostProcessor implementations to process any callback interfaces it can find and call the appropriate methods.
	
	- If you need custom features or other lifecycle behavior Spring does not offer out-of-the-box, you can implement a BeanPostProcessor yourself.
	
	- In addition to the initialization and destruction callbacks, Spring-managed objects may also implement the Lifecycle interface so that those 
	objects can participate in the startup and shutdown process as driven by the container’s own lifecycle.
	
	How to use 
		- org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean Interface
			void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception;
		
		- annotation: @PostConstruct
		
		- xml: <bean init-method="init" />
		
		- BeanPostProcessor - for custom features implementation
		
	Destruction callbacks
	---------------------
	- Implementing the org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean interface allows a bean to get a callback when the container containing it is destroyed.
	
	- It is recommended that you do not use the DisposableBean callback interface because it unnecessarily couples the code to Spring.
	
	- Alternatively, use the @PreDestroy annotation or specify a generic method that is supported by bean definitions.
	
	How to use:
		- org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean Interface
			void destroy() throws Exception;
			
		- annotation: @PreDestroy
		
		- xml: <bean destroy-method="cleanup" />
		
	Default initialization and destroy methods
	------------------------------------------
	- When you write initialization and destroy method callbacks that do not use the Spring-specific InitializingBean and DisposableBean callback 
	interfaces, you typically write methods with names such as init(), initialize(), dispose(), and so on.
	
	- You can configure the Spring container to look for named initialization and destroy callback method names on every bean.
	
	- This means that you, as an application developer, can write your application classes and use an initialization callback called init(), 
	without having to configure an init-method="init" attribute with each bean definition.
	
	How to use:
		- xml: <beans default-init-method="init" default-destroy-method="cleanup"></beans>
	
	Combining lifecycle mechanisms
	------------------------------
	- As of Spring 2.5, you have three options for controlling bean lifecycle behavior:
		- the InitializingBean and DisposableBean callback interfaces
		- custom init() and destroy() methods
		- the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations
		
	- You can combine these mechanisms to control a given bean.
	
	- Multiple lifecycle mechanisms configured for the same bean, with different initialization methods, are called as follows:
	
		- Methods annotated with @PostConstruct
		
		- afterPropertiesSet() as defined by the InitializingBean callback interface
		
		- A custom configured init() method
		
		Destroy methods are called in the same order:
			
			- Methods annotated with @PreDestroy
			
			- destroy() as defined by the DisposableBean callback interface
			
			- A custom configured destroy() method
			
	Startup and shutdown callbacks
	------------------------------
	- The Lifecycle interface defines the essential methods for any object that has its own lifecycle requirements 
	(e.g. starts and stops some background process)
	
	How to use:
	
		Lifecycle Interface
			- start()
			- stop()
			- isRunning()
			
		LifecycleProcessor Interface extends Lifecycle
			- onRefresh
			- onClose
			
		SmartLifecycle Interface extends Lifecycle, Phased
			- isAutoStartup()
			- stop(Runnable callback)
			
		<bean id="lifecycleProcessor" class="org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor">
    		<!-- timeout value in milliseconds -->
    		<property name="timeoutPerShutdownPhase" value="10000"/>
		</bean>	
	
	Shutting down the Spring IoC container gracefully in non-web applications
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- This section applies only to non-web applications.
	- If you are using Spring’s IoC container in a non-web application environment; 
		for example, in a rich client desktop environment; you register a shutdown hook with the JVM
	- Doing so ensures a graceful shutdown and calls the relevant destroy methods on your singleton beans so that all 
	resources are released. Of course, you must still configure and implement these destroy callbacks correctly.
	
	How to use:
		ConfigurableApplicationContext Interface and use registerShutdownHook() method

================================================================================================================		

ApplicationContextAware and BeanNameAware
-----------------------------------------
	ApplicationContextAware
	-----------------------
	- When an ApplicationContext creates an object instance that implements the 
	org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware interface, the instance is provided with a reference to that 
	ApplicationContext.
	
	- Thus beans can manipulate programmatically the ApplicationContext that created them, through the ApplicationContext interface.
	or by casting the reference to a known subclass of this interface, such as ConfigurableApplicationContext, which exposes additional functionality.
	
	- One use would be the programmatic retrieval of other beans.
	
	- Sometimes this capability is useful;
	
	- in general you should avoid it, because it couples the code to Spring and does not follow the Inversion of Control 
	style, where collaborators are provided to beans as properties.

	BeanFactoryAware -
	BeanNameAware - 
	BootstrapContextAware -
	LoadTimeWeaverAware 
	MessageSourceAware
	NotificationPublisherAware
