Container overview
------------------

- The interface org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the aforementioned beans.

- The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. It allows you to express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between such objects.

- Several implementations of the ApplicationContext interface are supplied out-of-the-box with Spring.
		
		- In standalone applications it is common to create an instance of ClassPathXmlApplicationContext or FileSystemXmlApplicationContext. 
		
- In most application scenarios, explicit user code is not required to instantiate one or more instances of a Spring IoC container. 

- In a web application scenario, a simple eight (or so) lines of boilerplate web descriptor XML in the web.xml file of the application will typically suffice.

- Refer Figure-1 The IoC Container.

Configuration metadata
----------------------

- As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of configuration metadata; 
this configuration metadata represents how you as an application developer tell the Spring container to instantiate, 
configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

- Configuration metadata is traditionally supplied in a simple and intuitive XML format, which is what most of 
this chapter uses to convey key concepts and features of the Spring IoC container.

- XML-based metadata is not the only allowed form of configuration metadata. 
The Spring IoC container itself is totally decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata 
is actually written. These days many developers choose Java-based configuration for their Spring applications.

- For information about using other forms of metadata with the Spring container, see:

	- Annotation-based configuration: Spring 2.5 introduced support for annotation-based configuration metadata.

	- Java-based configuration: Starting with Spring 3.0, many features provided by the Spring JavaConfig project 
	became part of the core Spring Framework. Thus you can define beans external to your application classes by using 
	Java rather than XML files. To use these new features, see the @Configuration, @Bean, @Import and @DependsOn annotations.
	
- These bean definitions correspond to the actual objects that make up your application. Typically you define service 
layer objects, data access objects (DAOs), presentation objects such as Struts Action instances, infrastructure objects 
such as Hibernate SessionFactories, JMS Queues, and so forth. Typically one does not configure fine-grained domain objects 
in the container, because it is usually the responsibility of DAOs and business logic to create and load domain objects.

=======================================================

Instantiating a container
-------------------------

- Instantiating a Spring IoC container is straightforward. The location path or paths supplied to an 
ApplicationContext constructor are actually resource strings that allow the container to 
load configuration metadata from a variety of external resources such as the local file system, 
from the Java CLASSPATH, and so on.

	ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");

=======================================================
	
Using the container
-------------------

- The ApplicationContext is the interface for an advanced factory capable of maintaining a registry of different beans and their dependencies. Using the method T getBean(String name, Class<T> requiredType) you can retrieve instances of your beans.

	==> ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
	
- With Groovy configuration, bootstrapping looks very similar, just a different context implementation class which is Groovy-aware (but also understands XML bean definitions):

	==> ApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
	
- The most flexible variant is GenericApplicationContext in combination with reader delegates, e.g. with XmlBeanDefinitionReader for XML files:

	GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
	new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.xml", "daos.xml");
	context.refresh();
	
Or with GroovyBeanDefinitionReader for Groovy files:

	GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
	new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(context).loadBeanDefinitions("services.groovy", "daos.groovy");
	context.refresh();
