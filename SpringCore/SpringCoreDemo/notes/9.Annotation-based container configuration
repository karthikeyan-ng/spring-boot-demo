Annotation-based container configuration
----------------------------------------
	XML vs Annotation which is better?
		- it depends on the strategy. Each approach has its own pros and cons. 
		- it is up to the developer to decide which strategy suits them better
		
	<context:annotation-config/>
		- The implicitly registered post-processors include 
				AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, 
				CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, 
				PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, as well as the aforementioned 
				RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.
				
		- INFO: <context:annotation-config/> only looks for annotations on beans in the same 
		application context in which it is defined. This means that, if you put <context:annotation-config/> 
		in a WebApplicationContext for a DispatcherServlet, it only checks for @Autowired beans in your 
		controllers, and not your services. See The DispatcherServlet for more information.
		
		- @Required
		
		- @Autowired
		
		- @Primary
			- Because autowiring by type may lead to multiple candidates, it is often necessary to have 
			more control over the selection process. One way to accomplish this is with Spring’s @Primary 
			annotation.
			
			XML: <bean class="example.SimpleMovieCatalog" primary="true">
			
		- Fine-tuning annotation-based autowiring with qualifiers
			- @Primary is an effective way to use autowiring by type with several instances when one primary candidate can be determined. 
			
			- When more control over the selection process is required, Spring’s @Qualifier annotation can be used.
